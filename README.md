######Homework 4: A Simple Android App
######Due: March 6, 2015, 11:59pm

#####Objective: 
In  this  homework  assignment,  you  will  build  your  own simple  Android  application that interacts with the Google geocoding API. Read up on the API here:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/
There are many  such APIs  that it is exceedingly  useful  to work with from within your mobile apps. This  specific  API  has  a  simple  function:  it  converts  a  string  address  into  geographic coordinates.

#####Collaboration: 
This homework will ideally be performed in teams of two. You are also allowed to work independently.

#####The Assignment:
This assignment results in a simple Android app. But don’t let that make you think  that  the  assignment  itself  is simple.  The  assignment  is  also  staged  to  be  increasingly complex  for  an  increasingly  higher  grade.  If  you accomplish  the  basic  functionality  and demonstrate the result to one of the members of the teaching staff, you will get an 80%. If you accomplish  the  single  piece  of  advanced  functionality  (and  demonstrate  it),  you  can  get  an additional  5%.  The  remaining  15%  of  the  points  for  the  assignment  will  be  given  at  our discretion. At  the end of  this assignment, we will explain how you can go about getting  those points.

#####The  Base  Assignment: 
For  this  assignment,  you  must  create  an  Android  app  with  some (simple; not required to be fancy) user interface. Through the interface, the user should be able to enter a location in a text box and then press a button to submit that location string as a query to the Google geocoding API. You should use that location to make a query to the Google geocoding API. Upon  returning  the location  coordinates, your app  should  plot  the location on a map. To display the map, you’re going to want to use the Android MapView and/or MapFragment and connect into the Google Maps service.

#####The First Bonus:
To  receive an additional  5%  points  for  this assignment, you must  choose one  additional  piece  of  information  returned  to  you  from  the  Google  geocoding  call  and choose  a  way  to  use  or  display  that  information  in  your  app.  If  you  use  any  external resources to complete this assignment, you must clearly cite them.

#####The Double Bonus: 
To fill out the remainder of the assignment grade (if you choose, and it’s not required), you must choose one or more additional features to add to your app. When you’ve completed  their addition, you  should describe what you’ve done and  suggest  (and justify)  a  point  value  for  each  additional  feature  you  have.  (It  could  be  that  you  do something so amazingly awesome that you think it’s worth all 15%; it could be that you do three relatively reasonable things that are each 5%. Just be sure to make your case. And, no, repeating the first bonus three more times is not going to cut it.)What  to  Submit. You  should make your code available in a github  repository and  submit  the link. As before, you’ll have to submit this link as a comment in your submission since you’re also going  to  have  to  submit  a  document  associated  with  your  assignment. You  should  not  check into this repository after the due date of the assignment (or your assignment will be considered “late”). You will also need to demo your app. If you worked with a partner, before submitting, create a “group” for the two of you under People à Android Groups.
  
You should  also  submit  a  short  (less  than  a  page)  justification  of  the  bonus  portion  of  your assignment.  For any  bonus work  that  you  did,  you  should  (briefly)  describe  the  functionality, giving any details you  think are pertinent  to our assigning a grade. You  should also  suggest a point  value  for  each  bonus  portion  you  complete.  The  total  for  this  suggested  bonus  value should not exceed 15%. Obviously, there is no guarantee that we will agree with your allocation of points to features, but we will take your suggestions under advisement.
